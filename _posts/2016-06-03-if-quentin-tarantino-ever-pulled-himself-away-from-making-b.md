description: ' If Quentin Tarantino ever pulled himself away from making bloody brutal and darkly comedic movies and decided to make a little something within the D&D or Warcraft universe, the end result would be something like Revenge of the Elf (Nysta). Not only is the main hero a foul-mouthed and impossibly efficient killer, but the world which she inhabits is full of no-nonsense characters who drop f-bombs on a regular basis. If you can mind the fact that this four-letter word pops up as regularly as moles from their holes, then you can enjoy a sharply-written tale of vengeance, tense drama, and unflinchingly bloody action. It first reads like a straight-up revenge story ala "Kill Bill," but the surprising ending is something hardcore fans of fantasy can sink their teeth into. - Jason Hubbard, Amazon.com '
